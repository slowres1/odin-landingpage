Learning project for html and css

This was an end-of-css-module challenge  in the odin project, with the aim to build a webpage from scratch to look like the image in the references folder. I think I did a fairly decent job, though looking back theres clearly a lot of bloat in the css and html files - lots of unnecessary divs and weird usage of classes and ID's - I only remembered about nesting classes and assigning multiple classes about halfway through. Nonetheless, it gets the job done!
